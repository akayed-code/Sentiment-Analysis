# Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment analysis does opinion mining. It analyses peopleâ€™s sentiments, attitudes, or emotions towards certain entities. This project tackles a fundamental problem of sentiment analysis, sentiment polarity categorization. It also helps to block or filter out some disrespectful words used over internet to protect the mental health of each and every user on any platform where people are allowed to keep their opinions freely. Which would, in result, reduce cyberbullying.
